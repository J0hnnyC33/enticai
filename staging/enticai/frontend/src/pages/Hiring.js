                <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Enticai is on a mission to revolutionize how developers build and deploy applications. We're creating a powerful platform that enables developers to rapidly spin up full-stack applications with sophisticated backends and state management systems. Think Replit or Bolt.new, but with a crucial difference: we're focusing on generating production-ready backend architectures, not just frontends.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Initially, this role will be part-time, allowing you to maintain other commitments while we collaborate to build and validate our core technology. Upon securing seed funding, the position will transition to full-time, with competitive compensation reflecting your co-founder status. This approach lets us develop our working relationship and build a strong foundation before making a full-time commitment.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  As co-founders, we'll work closely together to build a platform that transforms how developers create applications. Your deep understanding of backend architectures and system design will be crucial as we develop AI systems that can generate sophisticated, scalable backend solutions. We'll be pushing the boundaries of what's possible in automated system architecture and code generation.
