"ENTICAI is a pre-seed AI lab focused on developing cutting-edge AI solutions. It was founded and led by John Smith, an AI researcher, former CFO, serial entreprenuer, and American."
"ENTICAI was born out of the realization that AI products are semi-obvious, they just need a small, capable, and well-equipped team."
